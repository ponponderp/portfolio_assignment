[NJIT Connections Lab / Collaborative Lifelogging (Spring 2019)](connectionslab)
<br><br>
The Connections Lab at NJIT studied how people build and maintain social connections with technology. Their overall goal was to transform the experience people have with new technologies, from understanding user needs to developing and evaluating those technologies with HCI ideals in mind. The lab itself was split into three different groups based on Research, Interface Design, and Instrcutre. I was a part of the Infrustrure team during my time at the Connections Lab from Spring 2019-Summer 2019.
