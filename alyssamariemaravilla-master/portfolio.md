[Senior Capstone / STEERus (Spring 2020) ](/steerus)
<br><br>
With <a href="https://www.steerus.io">STEERus</a> as my Senior capstone sponsor, I was placed in the Framework team where we were given the task of providing an intuitive application for the end user that helps them navigate through the application easily. We had to augment the existing basic framework of MangoApps with custom capsules (from our sister capstone team) and open source or other existing code via API integration.

<br><br>
For my IT490 Systems Integration Senior project, a team of four of us were tasked with creating a software as service utilizing a frontend, backend, database and data source server. For this project I managed the Frontend Server. Our product was a stock website where users can search and purchase stocks. Our servers were connected thru Rabbit MQ and hosted on Amazon Web Services.

ThinkLinks is a mobile application that was designed to help students find study groups within the NJIT community. The wireframe simply came from scenario-based design where we found an issue and used this application to solve the problem.
