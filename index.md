## Hello! 
<br>

I'm currently a graduate student at [New Jersey Institute of Technology](https://www.njit.edu) studying Information Systems, specializing in Data Analytics.
<br>

I graduated from New Jersey Institute Technology with a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology, specializing in Web Development back in 2020.
<br>

I can help build web applications and I also help you build a computer! [Current PC specs](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Ponponderp/saved/#view=FYMPXL)
<br><br>

Just a little bit about me, I have a strong passion for music. I go to a lot of concerts and I really like tech. 

Here are some photos of PC builds I've done in the past few years
