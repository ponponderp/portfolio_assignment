## Research Projects

[Social X Lab / Digital Patronage (Spring 2020)](https://socialinteractionlab.com/)
<br><br>
The Social Interaction Lab at NJIT is a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research lab that specializes in qualitative and quantitative methods. Studies done on how people interact with technologies such as social media, mobile phones, multiplayer games, etc. The group itself is interdisciplinary with projects based on psychology, computer science, communication and design. 
I was part of a Digital Patronage project, a term coined by Dr. Wohn, refers to how fans/supporters support content creators both financially and emotionally through new social media platforms. The research done for this was based on interviewing Patreon content creators and what benefits they gained from using this system over anything else. I was partipicated in the Social Interaction Lab from Spring 2020-Summer 2020.

[NJIT Connections Lab / Collaborative Lifelogging (Spring 2019)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/njitconnections/about/)
<br><br>
The Connections Lab at NJIT studied how people build and maintain social connections with technology. Their overall goal was to transform the experience people have with new technologies, from understanding user needs to developing and evaluating those technologies with HCI ideals in mind. The lab itself was split into three different groups based on Research, Interface Design, and Instrcutre. I was a part of the Infrustrure team during my time at the Connections Lab from Spring 2019-Winter 2019.
