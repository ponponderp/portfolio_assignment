<br>
1- Learn fundamentals of User Experience Design
<br>
2- Conduct user studies, conduct task analysis
<br>

<br>
4- Conduct user studies, task analysis, assess usability of information systems interfaces
<br>
5- Partcipate in interaction design of multiple media formats (web,mobile, immmersive interfaces)
<br>

For this course, I came up with the idea of SaveMySeat as an optimal solution as an app for small businesses in local communities and consumers in the communities to come together and grab a seat for a quick bite or to promote local businesses while also letting users know what is available from the given business

## [NJIT Course Review App / Advanced System Analysis and Design (IS663)](/is663) 
<br><br>
For my graduate degree, I was given the opportunity to take IS663 as a course, which is Advanced System Analysis and Design. From this course I was able to learn:
<br>
1- How to choose appropriate development methodology
<br>
2- Understand and critique formal software requirements.
<br>
3- Evaluate various architecture and design choices for specific systems and choose an optimal solution
<br>
4- Evaluate and exercise prototyping methodologies.
<br>
The result of the outcomes were my final project presentation, which was a prototype of the Course Review system which took NJIT into consideration.

## [Senior Capstone / STEERus (Spring 2020) ](/steerus)
<br><br>
With <a href="https://www.steerus.io">STEERus</a> as my Senior capstone sponsor, I was placed in the Framework team where we were given the task of providing an intuitive application for the end user that helps them navigate through the application easily. We had to augment the existing basic framework of MangoApps with custom capsules (from our sister capstone team) and open source or other existing code via API integration.

For my IT490 Systems Integration Senior project, a team of four of us were tasked with creating a software as service utilizing a frontend, backend, database and data source server. For this project I managed the Frontend Server. Our product was a stock website where users can search and purchase stocks. Our servers were connected thru Rabbit MQ and hosted on Amazon Web Services.

ThinkLinks is a mobile application that was designed to help students find study groups within the NJIT community. The wireframe simply came from scenario-based design where we found an issue and used this application to solve the problem.
