### Role: Frontend Framework Developer 

For my Senior Capstone, I was able to work with <a href="https://www.steerus.io/">STEERus</a>. The Framework team consisted of 5 members:
- Project Manager 
- 2 Frontend Developers
- 2 Backend API Developers

<br>
For the Spring 2020 semester, I was able to work with another Frontend developer, where we split our tasks accordingly.
<br>
**STEERus** is a lean startup that plans on creating a social coaching platform for students and new graduates to be prepared for the real world, helping people develop their soft skills.
<br>
We worked in an agile environment and used Trello to keep track of our progress throughout the semester. We communicated thru weekly scrum calls with our project manager and our sponsors throughout each sprint. And at the end of each sprint, we would reflect on what we learned and what we could improve on.

### Overall Goals:

- Custom Skins based on user types
- Improve Navigation for User Types
- Define and design how coaching capsules will work in MangoApps
- Defined Coaching Journey 
<br><br>

Using the <a href="https://www.mangoapps.com/">MangoApps Digital Workplace Platform</a>, as it is an integrated suite of workplace apps, our team was tasked with changing the default branding to fit the needs of our sponsor, as well as improving overall navigation for our user types, students and coaches.

### Completed Deliverables:
- **MangoApps Branding Customization**
<br>
Navbar changes for MangoApps:

<br>
Using custom CSS, we were able to change the branding on MangoApps to match STEERus and their branding.
<br>

- **Improve Navigation/Create Specific User Flows**
<br>
Coach users have more "admin" roles and access across the app. They also manage students and can communicate with them. 
<br>

<br>
Student users are split between "Freemium" and "Premium" access types to coaching capsules. The limitations on access were determined by if the user paid for the service or not.

- **Coaching Capsules in MangoApps Framework:**
<br>
Coaching Capsules are the main content for STEERus, and we created specific coaching capsules based on the Top 10 soft skills found on their website, along with other capsules we felt fit with the situation going on during the semester. For "Premium" capsules, a lock indicates that free users cannot access it and they are asked to notify an admin if they are interested in joining/payment. 
<br>

<br>
We utilized the "Projects" module in the MangoApps framework for Coaching Capsules with all the posibilities of customization that it allowed us to include for different modules to be included
<br>

Free Coaching Capsules only have "Posts" and "Pages" modules in them, there is limited content for these users.

<br>
Premium Coaching Capsules have more modules available and allow Student users to communicate with coaches and other resources that can provide benefits as well.

<br>
- **Defined Coaching Journey**
<br>
Only Premium Students have access to this in coaching capsules! With the MangoApps framework we utilized the "Tasks" module.
<br>
It is essentially a progress tracker that shows the tasks a user needs to complete a coaching journey and their current progress.

## Overall Capstone Reflection:
Working in an agile environment was very interesting, especially with the changes that occured with moving to completely meeting up online due to COVID-19. At first I didn’t understand how I could
play around with MangoApps, but when given the admin role there’s just so much that can
changed and edited within the platform. This is my first time playing around with a commercial
product like this, and it gave me a better idea of how a lot of businesses run their own
inner-company websites, since that’s what MangoApps is for
